    <h1>Softsense Sucks</h1>
    <p>
      Softsense is an indian company ran by a 10 year old. They sell an
      unactivated copy of Windows named "StarOS". It includes a fake temp files
      cleaner and a lot of unnecessary bloatware. <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Softsense Antivirus</h2>
      Softsense has an antivirus called "Softsense Antivirus". It is a fake
      antivirus, made in Thunkable - a free android no-code app builder for kids. It does not detect any threats. You can watch the video made by Cra-Z Tech on that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCWYv2RyZm4">here</a>.
