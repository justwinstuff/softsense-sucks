    <h1>[MIRROR 2] Exposing Softsense</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, hello! This is a simple page dedicated to exposing Softsense - A
      "company" ran by an 11 year old. Imagine a 10 year old owning a company.
      It will be a mess (and possibly illegal), right? <br />
      <br />
      <h4>This is the logo. It's a Canva template. See it <a href="https://www.canva.com/templates/EAGQZ836wSk-green-modern-marketing-logo/">here</a>.</h4>

      Now lettuce begin!
    </p>
    <h2>1. The website</h2>
    <p>
      Every good company needs a website, right? Well, Windows 8 Lover (The founder of Softsense), by tradition, made a website… in Google Sites.
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/C552c5Hh/image.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <h3>Softsense PCs</h3>
    <p>
      The website has a page with… Softsense PCs? Actually, it's a scam. The images there are of Fingers PCs with the Softsense logo.<br>If you buy the expensive one you get 1 year of Star AI, but only if you choose StarOS Ultimate. <i>(by the way, the AI doesn't exist.) </i> <br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/vyQJ2BX/image.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <h2>2. The vibe coding</h2>
    <p>
      After a few months, he decided to make a “website on his own”. And so he wasted hours using ChatGPT to “code” his website. He also claimed to have "learned html" from a stupid android app. And so, here is the “final product”.

      <caption><a href="https://softsense.tiiny.site"><i>https://softsense.tiiny.site</i></a></caption>
      <h3>The lies about what the site runs on</h3>
      The footer of the website has a few absurd names for “software”, like: “Softsense HTML and CSS checker v2.4”. It's actually running on Netlify, and refuses to show the truth.<br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/yF2x9mrs/image.png" style="height: 100px;" alt="">
    </p>
    <h2>3. Softsense Antivirus</h2>
    <p>
      Softsense finally released its first product - an antivirus, that wasn't even an antivirus.<br>In fact, it was made using Thunkable, a no-code app building platform that allows users to create powerful native mobile apps without writing any code. You can watch the video made by Cra-Z on that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCWYv2RyZm4">here</a>.<br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mFChjV2X/image.png" alt="">
      <h3>"Guys tell me the malware i will add those to scan"</h3>
      Right as the Cra-Z team published the video about the antivirus, the so called “owner” showed up and said this. <br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/hwFTtmS/image.png" style="height: 150px;" alt=""> <br>
      There's no way this kid will manually add every single Android malware sample in the world to the scan and call it a day.
      <h3>The logo</h3>
      When the Cra-Z team reversed searched the logo, they found out that the antivirus logo was actually the logo of a company called "Fortified Host".
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/NQgxmhX/image.png" alt="">
      <h3>The ads</h3>
      Alongside with the Antivirus, there were some very “high quality” trailers. When I say high quality, you doubt it is. Because, he made like 3 trailers for it.
      The first one was him showcasing the UI, but forgot to hide the Thunkable stuff. <br>Which explains why the Antivirus doesn’t work. He may know HTML but doesn’t know any Java or Kotlin. You can watch the video <a href="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/softsense_av_ad.mp4">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Windows 10.5</h2>
    <p>
      Before we start, I want to clarify that Windows 10.5 is a great Windows mod. We'll be talking about Softsense's Windows 10.5.
      <br><br>
      Windows 8 Lover (8.1 Lover at the time) just randomly decided that Windows 10.5 is his own mod... <br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/WvbmH4DS/image.png" style="height: 100px;" alt="">
      <h3>Revision Tool</h3>
      When his own version of the mod released, he included ReviOS's Revision Tool (that allows you to change some settings) which is licensed under GPL-3.0. He also didn't give any credits to MeetRevision.<br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/Sk7j3Sb/image.png" style="height: 100px;" alt="">
      <h3>ReviOS</h3>
      After a few days, a moderator in the Revision Discord joined the server for Windows 10.5. <br>
      And turns out, the whole ReviOS playbook was included, still without credit. <br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/JR33ZpDd/image.png" alt="">
      <h3>Multiple mods combined</h3>
      Yeah, Windows 10.5 was Rectify11, ReviOS playbook, the "Ghost Toolbox" from Ghost Spectre and a Windows 11 skin.
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TB67J1rm/image.png" style="height: 100px;" alt="">
      <h3>The trailer</h3>
      The trailer (you can watch it <a href="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/win105.mp4">here</a>) showed Fluentize 10 instead of the mod it was supposed to show... <i>(not confirmed)</i><br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/chyxgt6N/image.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <h2>StarOS</h2>
    <p>The so-called StarOS is actually just Windows 10 with his "self made software", which by running wireshark and opening all of the apps, found out that they're actually websites.</p>
    <p>The setup itself was trying to hide the fact that you were actually installing Windows.</p>
    <img src="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/setup.jpg" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <p>And when i clicked on "Install now", i was greeted to this Gaber Samir-like monstrosity:</p>
    <img src="https://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/gabersamir.jpg" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <p>Now back to the "self made software", when we ran Wireshark to see what websites the apps were redirecting to, we found it all out. Below, i will list the link to all of the websites that i managed to find, and i will also explain what they do.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://poetic-cactus-791fc4.netlify.app/">Site 1: StarOS Welcome Center</a></h1>
    <img src="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/welcomecenter.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <p>This website simply "tells your system specs". However, almost the entire page is lying.</p>
    <p>First, I am using a Chromium based browser. I thought it was supposed to show my browser name, not my browser agent!</p>
    <p>The screen resolution is a lie too! It actually is the resolution of the browser window.</p>
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
	    <source src="softwelcomefind.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <p>Second, i have 8gb of RAM, not 0.5.</p>
    <p>And at last, i have 12 cores in my PC.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://polite-cocada-d1dc37.netlify.app/">Site 2: StarCleaner</a></h1>
    <p>This "app" claims to clean your system. But it's actually just showing you random files that don't exist on your PC, and "deletes them".</p>
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
	    <source src="starcleaner.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <p>Now when i was inspecting the source code of this "cleaner", i have came across the obvious proof that it was actually made by ChatGPT.</p>
    <img src="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/gpt.png" style="height: 50px;" alt="">
    <p>And while i was inspecting the source code further, i have found out that the cleaner is indeed fake, since it has a function to generate random files that don't even exist on the system.</p>
    <img src="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/randomfile.png" style="height: 80px;" alt="">
    <p>There was also a sound that played once you clicked on the clean files button. It's hard to notie it playing, so here it is.</p>
    <audio controls src="wood_plank_flicks.ogg"></audio>
    <h1><a href="https://enchanting-brigadeiros-77f287.netlify.app/">Site 3: Softsense Calendar</a></h1>
    <img src="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/calendar.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <p>It looks fine and all, but the code...</p>
    <img src="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/code.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <h1><a href="https://splendorous-basbousa-d0ab9f.netlify.app/">Site 4: StarOS Game Hub</a></h1>
    <img src="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/gamehub.png" style="height:300px;" alt="">
    <p>Here it's just the classical 3 games: Snake, Tetris and Tic-Tac-Toe.</p>
    <p>Now while i was writing the StarOS part for this document, the "Company Owner" thought his copyright website took our website down. Neither does he know, he spelt the URL wrong.</p>
    <img src="http://revivelinux.komaru-yml.xyz/softsense-sucks/dumbkid.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <h2>The X Saga</h2>
    <p>After the ultimate downfall of Softsense, he randomly found some quotes that "would make his company popular" and decided to spam them on his X account.</p>
    <img src="spam1.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam2.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam3.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam4.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam5.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam6.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam7.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam8.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam9.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam10.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam11.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <img src="spam12.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <p>Those "quotes" didn't get him anywhere near popular, but right after that, he made an AI generated website for the mod that he randomly decided is his. (Windows 10.5)</p>
    <img src="ai105.png" style="height: 500px;" alt="">
    <p>And what do you know, he used ChatGPT for this one aswell.</p>
    <img src="gpt2.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <p>Also by doing a bit of more inspect elementing, i found out that he is using Discord's CDN to host the images for the website.</p>
    <img src="dccdn.png" style="height: 100px;" alt="">
    <p>If youre living under a rock or you have never used Discord before, you may know that all CDN link expire after 2 days. So basically the website has no screenshots and no logo aswell.</p>
    <img src="105broken.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <p>The tutoeial and the website looks fine in general. I'll leave a link here soon if you want to look at it for yourself.</p>
    <h1>This is all for now! Any future action made by Softsense will be documented here.</h1>
