    <h1>Exposing Softsense</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, hello! This is a simple page dedicated to exposing Softsense - A
      "company" ran by an 11 year old. Imagine a 10 year old owning a company.
      It will be a mess, right? <br />
      <br />

      Now lettuce begin!
    </p>
    <h2>1. The website</h2>
    <p>
      Every good company needs a website, right? Well, Windows 8 Lover (The founder of Softsense), by tradition, made a website… in Google Sites.

    </p>
    <h3>Softsense PCs</h3>
    <p>
      The website has a page with… Softsense PCs? Actually, it's a scam. The images there are of Fingers PCs with the Softsense logo.<br>If you buy the expensive one you get 1 year of Star AI, but only if you choose StarOS Ultimate. <i>(by the way, the AI doesn't exist.) </i> <br>

    </p>
    <h2>2. The vibe coding</h2>
    <p>
      After a few months, he decided to make a “website on his own”. And so he wasted hours using ChatGPT to “code” his website. And so, here is the “final product”.

      <h3>The lies about what the site runs on</h3>
      The footer of the website has a few absurd names for “software”, like: “Softsense HTML and CSS checker v2.4”. <br>

    </p>
    <h2>3. Softsense Antivirus</h2>
    <p>
      Softsense finally released its first product - an antivirus, that wasn't even an antivirus.<br>In fact, it was made using Thunkable, a no-code app building platform that allows users to create powerful native mobile apps without writing any code. You can watch the video made by Cra-Z on that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCWYv2RyZm4">here</a>.<br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mFChjV2X/image.png" alt="">
      <h3>"Guys tell me the malware i will add those to scan"</h3>
      Right as the Cra-Z team published the video about the antivirus, the so called “owner” showed up and said this. <br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/hwFTtmS/image.png" style="height: 150px;" alt=""> <br>
      There's no way this kid will manually add every single Android malware sample in the world to the scan and call it a day.
      <h3>The logo</h3>
      When the Cra-Z team reversed searched the logo, they found out that the antivirus logo was actually the logo of a company called "Fortified Host".
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/NQgxmhX/image.png" alt="">
      <h3>The ads</h3>
      Alongside with the Antivirus, there were some very “high quality” trailers. When I say high quality, you doubt it is. Because, he made like 3 trailers for it.
      The first one was him showcasing the UI, but forgot to hide the Thunkable stuff. <br>Which explains why the Antivirus doesn’t work. He may know HTML but doesn’t know any Java or Kotlin. You can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIl_oEbpF58">here</a>.

    <h2>4. Windows 10.5</h2>
    <p>
      Before we start, I want to clarify that Windows 10.5 is a great Windows mod. We'll be talking about Softsense's Windows 10.5.
      <br><br>
      Windows 8 Lover (8.1 Lover at the time) just randomly decided that Windows 10.5 is his own mod... <br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/WvbmH4DS/image.png" style="height: 100px;" alt="">
      <h3>Revision Tool</h3>
      When his own version of the mod released, he included ReviOS's Revision Tool (that allows you to change some settings) which is licensed under GPL-3.0. He also didn't give any credits to MeetRevision.<br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/Sk7j3Sb/image.png" style="height: 100px;" alt="">
      <h3>ReviOS</h3>
      After a few days, a moderator in the Revision Discord joined the server for Windows 10.5. <br>
      And turns out, the whole ReviOS playbook was included, still without credit. <br>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/JR33ZpDd/image.png" alt="">
      <h3>Multiple mods combined</h3>
      Yeah, Windows 10.5 was Rectify11, ReviOS playbook, the "Ghost Toolbox" from Ghost Spectre and a Windows 11 skin.
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TB67J1rm/image.png" style="height: 100px;" alt="">
      <h3>The trailer</h3>
      The trailer (you can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N57IerqzSOI">here</a>) showed Fluentize 10 instead of the mod it was supposed to show... <i>(not confirmed)</i><br>
